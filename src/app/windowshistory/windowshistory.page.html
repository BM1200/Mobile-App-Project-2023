  <p>Windows is a series of operating systems developed and sold by Microsoft. The first version of Windows, called Windows 1.0, was released in 1985 as a graphical user interface (GUI) for MS-DOS, which was the dominant operating system at the time.

    Over the years, Windows continued to evolve and improve, with new versions being released every few years. Windows 95 was a major milestone, as it was the first version to feature the iconic Start button and taskbar, which are still used in modern versions of Windows.
    
    Windows XP, which was released in 2001, was another major milestone for the operating system. It was the first version of Windows to be widely adopted in both consumer and enterprise markets, and it remained the most popular version of Windows for over a decade.

    In more recent years, Microsoft has continued to innovate with Windows 10, which was released in 2015. Windows 10 features a new interface, improved performance, and tighter integration with other Microsoft products and services, such as OneDrive and the Microsoft Store.
    
    Microsoft has also made significant investments in cloud computing, with its Azure platform and Office 365 suite of productivity apps, which are available on Windows and other platforms.
    
    Overall, Windows has had a profound impact on the technology industry and has helped to shape the way we interact with computers and other devices. Its continued evolution and innovation are a testament to Microsoft's commitment to staying at the forefront of the technology industry.</p>
